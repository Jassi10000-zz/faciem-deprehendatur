# Faciem-Deprehendatur ðŸ¤–

  * Faciem-Deprehendatur is a web application which can our Real Time AI Face Landmark Detection 
  * Its a great technique that uses Machine Learning , Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligance to detect different points on our face
  * The points detected when combined together generates a mesh on the face . The Face Detector in this project detects 486 3D facial landmarks to infer the approximate surface 
    geometry of a human face .
  
# General workflow :
  The project requires usage of pre-trained model named as " FaceMesh ðŸ˜Š " , it simply detects our face in real time and shows a 3D mesh on our face
  * A webcam stream is created inside a front-end React App
  * FaceMesh model is loaded from TensorFlow.Js Library and detections are made from the webcam stream running
  * Keypoints and Triangles are drawn on JavaScript Canvas







Snapchat also uses Facial Landmark detection  to apply different filters on your face
