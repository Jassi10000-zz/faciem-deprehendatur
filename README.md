# Faciem-Deprehendatur 🤖

  * Faciem-Deprehendatur is a web application which can our Real Time AI Face Landmark Detection 
  * Its a great technique that uses Machine Learning , Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligance to detect different points on our face
  * The points detected when combined together generates a mesh on the face . The Face Detector in this project detects 486 3D facial landmarks to infer the approximate surface 
    geometry of a human face .
    
# Tech Stack Used :

 <h3> 🔥 Tensorflow.Js and React.js 💥</h3>

## Here's a nice preview of the project by me 😎:

# General workflow ▶:
  The project requires usage of pre-trained model by TensorflowJs named as " FaceMesh 😊 " , it simply detects our face in real time and shows a 3D mesh on our face
  * A webcam stream is created inside a front-end React App
  * FaceMesh model is loaded from TensorFlow.Js Library and detections are made from the webcam stream running
  * Keypoints and Triangles are drawn on JavaScript Canvas


## So now u must have known how SnapChat and Instagram apply filters on our face😍.  They also do Facial Landmark detection to apply filters.
